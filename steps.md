## Key Innovation: Non-Keyword Trend Detection

Traditional keyword-based trend detection is limited to predefined terms and may miss emerging trends. Our enhanced system includes:

1. **Statistical Anomaly Detection**: Identifies unusual spikes in term frequency
2. **N-gram Analysis**: Discovers new multi-word phrases and expressions
3. **Semantic Clustering**: Groups related content to identify thematic trends
4. **Engagement Velocity**: Tracks how quickly content gains traction
5. **Cross-Platform Correlation**: Identifies trends spreading across platforms

This approach ensures we can detect truly emerging trends that don't match existing keywords, providing a comprehensive view of the beauty industry's evolving landscape.
